; This defines the basic album datatype.
(define-struct album (title artist genre))
; define-struct automatically creates the following functions for you:
;
; `make-<struct-name>` (in this case `make-album`)
;   a function to create an instance of the struct
;   this function takes arguments for each of the fields listed, so for example
;   (make-struct 'Sway' 'Tove Styrke' 'Pop') will create an album struct
;    with title 'Sway', artist 'Tove Styrke' & genre 'Pop
;
; `<struct-name>-<field-name>` (for each field)
;    functions for accessing values of each field in the struct
;    for album this would mean we'd have the following functions:
;    `album-title`, `album-artist`, `album-genre`
;    the following examples creates an album and then accesses its fields
;    ```
;    (define sway (make-album 'Sway' 'Tove Styrke' 'Pop')
;    (album-title sway) ; returns 'Sway'
;    (album-artist sway) ; returns 'Tove Styrke'
;    (album-genre sway) ; returns 'Pop'
;    ```
;
; `<struct-name>?` (in this case `album?`)
;   a predicate (function which returns a boolean) that checks a value and
;   returns true if it's an instance of the struct, false otherwise
;   using the `sway` album defined in the previous example
;   ```
;   (album? sway) ; returns true
;   (album? 1) ; returns false
;   (album? 'hi') ; returns false
;   ```

;;; Enter a list of albums below
;;; They need not be the actual albums you own.
;;; But you should include enough variety to adequately
;;; test your code.
;;;
;;; Here's what we mean.  One of the questions involves
;;; writing a procedure that finds all the albums of a
;;; given genre.  If all the albums in the library are
;;; in the rock genre, then there's only one genre and
;;; when you ask for all the rock albums and it gives
;;; back all the albums, you don't know whether that's
;;; because the code really works, or because it's
;;; not even paying attention to the genre.  So you want
;;; to make sure there are multiple artists and genres,
;;; some artists with only one album or genre, others
;;; with multiple artists or genres, etc.
